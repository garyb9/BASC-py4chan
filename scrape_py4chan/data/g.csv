Its the same way that many other Fediverse platforms that are different in scope (ie PeerTube for instance) can also be somewhat compatible with another service thanks to shared standards.   <br><br>I&#039;m not sure about Hubzilla specifically since I&#039;ve not worked with it, but  other &#039;macro social&#039; (ie Facebook-ish) style setups like Diaspora and Friendica , as well as others such as the Instagram-style  Pixelfed and of course PeerTube have some cross functionality with the microblogging (ie Mastodon et al) platforms.  For instance, you can make a post on Mastodon, but also have it sent as a short status post within your Diaspora/Friendica account, or  you can set it up to  toot on Mastodon   when you upload a new video on PeerTube  as something of an announcement.  <br><br>A certain amount of interoperability even between differing Fediverse platforms is nice and yet another benefit over proprietary socials.",

Your average normie is going to buy a single 2TB drive and that will be enough, and when they run out of storage, they&#039;ll buy an external HDD. If they&#039;re the creative type, they can buy a single drive all the way up to 16TB. prosumers will be satisfied with an off the shelf NAS solution, and professional users will go to HPE for an extended service agreement.<br><br>The extremely niche market of /g/ that don&#039;t need hot swap bays, but still need a ton of storage, we can all just buy fractal R6 or 7, and use the motherboard SATA, integrated realtek NICs, and $30 flashed LSI HBAs, mounting everything internally. These drives will probably be spun down 95% of the time anyways.<br><br>If you need proper redundant storage, the numbers for low end chassis and hardware stop making sense. Hotswap cages are expensive, and once you run the numbers, your better off buying a proper 2u or 4u chassis with a proper SAS backplane so you can use SFF SAS cables and not have literally dozens of SATA cables snaking around like all the builds seen here. And everything can be hung on a wall or in a rack in a neat 2U or 4U form factor.<br><br>With lower end hardware, you start running into hard limitations like lack of PCIe lanes for NVMe drives, HBAs, NICs, compute, etc. You also want IPMI, because you do not want to work with a loud server beside you. Once you factor in the price of at least 8x16TB HDDs, buying high end components does not add a significant percentage to the total cost, AND everything can be written off as an expense, so you might as well sneak in a few parts for your personal rig in there as well.",http://i.4cdn.org/g/1586159159592.jpg

Also this 5G network is to be installed in all our British Nuclear Power Plants around the country!! Which will give them full control. Beijing could use Huawei’s involvement as a back-door method of spying on British communications, and warned that it may scale down intelligence cooperation! There is already a Chinese owned power plant already being constructed in this Country! Also this will mean that our country could be held to ransom for a fall out if the network infrastructure is hacked! Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, faces charges that include alleged violation of sanctions against Iran. A Canadian court will decide if she’s extradited to the US, which has raised concerns about Chinese intelligence services using Huawei’s 5G technology as a so-called ‘back door’ to conduct operations in cyberspace.",http://i.4cdn.org/g/1586134089795.jpg
