The stories main driving point is the romance that briefly kindled between Dina and Ellie.<br><br>- Ellie and Joel are distant because of Joel being controlling stemming from the decision in TLoU but are starting to try and mend their relationship.<br><br>- There is a love triangle of sorts, not exactly a triangle as its just two people who love Dina, being Jesse and Ellie.<br><br>- Jesse (asian guy from the trailers) and Dina were a couple. Dina is bisexual.<br><br>- When Jesse and Dina are on the outs of their relationship Dina starts to make advances on Ellie.<br><br>- Due to Dina being the girl every guy wants and having a history dating men (men being a central driving force in this story) Ellie is cautious and is unsure of how serious Dina is.<br><br>- However after several flirtatious gestures Ellie begins to question if Dina really does loves Ellie, and Ellie ultimately begins to fall for her.<br><br>- Act 1 concludes with Diana and Ellie sharing an important intimate moment solidifying the relationship played through act 1.<br><br>- That is until they are interrupted and attacked by a religious sect called the Seraphites (one of 2 groups we encounter, the other being the WLF).<br><br>- Jackson is also attacked.<br><br>- Dina is killed in this attack.<br><br>- The Seraphites believe they are angels cleansing the wasteland. The old &quot;the end of the world is cause of the sinners&quot; trope.<br><br>- Anyone that is not a Seraphite is considered a &quot;wolf&quot; or &quot;enemy to the flock (the Seraphites)&quot;. They also refer to themselves as &quot;lambs&quot;<br><br>- In the vein of SJW baddies, the Seraphites dont like gays because its a sin.<br><br>- This is why all their members are *usually* white males with shaven heads or white women. And the few apostates (traitors) that leave the group tend to be minorities.<br><br>- Ellie vows to get revenge on the group.",http://i.4cdn.org/v/1586156129947.jpg

It easily has the best combat out of any FPS game and that isn&#039;t even debatable. Quake might let you do some more interesting movement tech, but the enemies don&#039;t push back nearly as hard as DE&#039;s. DE on nightmare plays unlike any other FPS made. Every enemy type is relevant, from start to finish. Not a lot of FPS, hell not even a lot of action games in general can claim that. DE also has an INSANE amount of enemy variety compared to most other games, which makes it even more impressive. You can like Duke, the og Doom games and/or Blood more for their non-linear level design, their &quot;soul&quot; or whatever, but DE&#039;s moment-to-moment combat is far, far superior to any of them. If you&#039;re like me and love FPS games specifically for their combat, DE is pretty much the perfect game. Its honestly like a dream come true. The only other classic FPS that comes close to pushing you as much as DE is Blood, but Blood literally only has one enemy type that matters, the cultists. Everything else might as well not even be there because they can&#039;t do anything to you. Blood also goes to shit halfway through, but that&#039;s a different discussion.",

847,/v/,502293192,,"<a href=""#p502290960"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;502290960</a><br>Yes, the games have a far more fleshed out campaign than Cold Waters where you can take control of multiple classes of subs at any point in the war with varying orders to patrol a certain position, medals, rewards, and crew management. Most of your time is going to be spent looking for a target but there&#039;s a time compression feature that lets you speed up the boring parts. Besides experimental late war prototypes there are no homing torpodes; there&#039;s a setting that aims them automatically for you but 90% of the game&#039;s fun comes from obtaining a correct manual solution and getting direct hits.<br><br>What game you want depends on your interest, if you&#039;re intrigued by the Pacific theater and sinking Jap boats then go with SH4 plus the U-boat missions add on. If you want Das Boot - The Video Game then both SH3 and SH5 are good contenders, the latter obviously looks better and has some very in depth mods but you can only play the VII type U-boat and crew management is more limited. And speaking of mods, they&#039;re pretty much essential for all of these games. You can find all the biggest ones on subsim.com which is pretty much the only place where SH is discussed these days.",
