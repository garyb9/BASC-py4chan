0,/r9k/,23675577,Welcome to /r9k/,"/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts.<br><br>

1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>
2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>
3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, 
your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>
4. Backlinks, eg <span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the 
eyes of the robot.<br>
5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>
6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>
7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>
8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>
9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>
10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>
11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>
12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD:<br>

With Corona I predict a lot of young people will fail the class or be fucked. If you fail, just know most people don&#039;t even finish college. But you still can with a little work. Can you change majors? Industrial design may pay less, but there are many things you can do to increase your income well in the field. Many people can use a designer. Many people lack creativity and the skill to draw. With youtube and maybe a website? You could reach your own clients. Many people in any country lack a good looking house and go day to day without even the thought of redesigning their space. The engineering job I expect will make you more money and is a safer bet, but don&#039;t force yourself. If you would like to stop college have plan. Don&#039;t drop out or just fail your classes. Don&#039;t overthink recession or how much a job pays. The reason people in creative fields make no money is because they lack the ability to market themselves and treat the art as a skill, not as a money maker. Think of how you can make money with designing. Make a chart showing advantages and disadvantages of both fields.",

I am a very cold person on the exterior, but on the inside I am constantly either mildly unhappy to deeply hateful and scared of myself. I am 20 years old and I am terrified I will never make any new meaningful connections with anyone. My dad sometimes says he never knows how to approach me because I am always stone faced, and he never knows how I&#039;m feeling. Back in middle school I would be teased for sounding high, because my voice was always flat and monotone. I am not scared (I think) of approaching women, yet I never have gone for it. On 3 separate occasions I consciously knew 3 different girls were obviously flirting with me, yet I shot them all down with signs of disinterest, even though I was interested. I have only 2 male friends at the moment, and I only hang out with one of them like once a month. My mom dug up some home videos on VHS from 2004 of me fishing and playing and stuff. She was so happy to see it for the first time in 15 years, and I put on a happy face for her. On the inside, it was hard watching a small version of myself without all the emotionally cold built up dread I have felt for the better part of a decade. I hate to blame other people for my shortcomings, but I&#039;m pretty sure this started after my dad started being really mean to me and my brothers when I was 11. They are mostly nice now, but it is hard being forced to live at home instead of the college dorms.
