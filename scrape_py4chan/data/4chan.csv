92,/pol/,252176184,,"Mass media has triggered a Cold Civil War in the West. The war is between what I refer to as Cosmopolitans and Essentialists.

It&#039;s just increased the flow of information so drastically, that all the issues that can be resolved will be resolved.

These two perspectives can not be reconciled, and their consequences account for nearly all the fronts of this Cold Civil War.<br><br>What I mean by essence, is some unalterable, inherent aspect of a person. Hunger, for instance, is part of the essence. You can&#039;t really shape it, you can&#039;t avoid it, you can&#039;t teach it away. And most importantly, you can&#039;t get rid of it.

You&#039;d probably experience the same feelings of familiarity and would have regular interaction, but at the end of the day, you are human, and they are animals. Whatever relationship you share with those gorillas cannot be equated to the relationship you&#039;d otherwise have with your birth family. My point is that the genetic similarities you share with your kin are the basis for that familial love.<br><br>As I mentioned earlier though, I do acknowledge that race is not everything in these matters, so you could instead think of it like: would you get along with a group of friends who love blaring really loud music and getting into trouble (assuming that you hate these things) or are you going to get along better with a group of friends who share your interests? How much you want to factor genetic circumstances into these personality traits is up to you, but if you knew that a particular group is more likely to act in a way that you find intolerable, will you generally be willing to associate with them?

He keeps for himself the obscure science of mixing with the Aryan blood, which allows him to keep an appearance of real blood in his cybernetic veins.

Only by lying can he make his deceit, his falsification and his corruption to last long. &quot;The jew is the organic lie&quot; Alfred Rosenberg would say.

I don&#039;t know who puts them up. At night I see Indic ganglike groups loitering the streets, none of this happened just 5 years ago. I go to a migrant majority neighbourhood. The police car is there every day. Everyone is racist to me, the Africans and the Afghans, who care not for integration and clearly think the suburb belongs to them. They are rude and unhelpful and if the state crime statistics website is to be trusted quite violent. They snicker and speak insults in their language in my face, blissfully unaware that I understand fluent Persian and Urdu. There are no whites anywhere save a single drunk. I never felt so lonely in my life. Just the thought of this spreading to the res of Australia brings a terrible fear and anger that further obliterates my now tattered open borders socialist political viewpoints. I see a doctor for a tendon injury. He is clearly Pakistani with a Lahore accent, but he says his home country is Britain. He knows less about medical treatments than I do.

The stories main driving point is the romance that briefly kindled between Dina and Ellie.<br><br>- Ellie and Joel are distant because of Joel being controlling stemming from the decision in TLoU but are starting to try and mend their relationship.<br><br>- There is a love triangle of sorts, not exactly a triangle as its just two people who love Dina, being Jesse and Ellie.<br><br>- Jesse (asian guy from the trailers) and Dina were a couple. Dina is bisexual.<br><br>- When Jesse and Dina are on the outs of their relationship Dina starts to make advances on Ellie.<br><br>- Due to Dina being the girl every guy wants and having a history dating men (men being a central driving force in this story) Ellie is cautious and is unsure of how serious Dina is.<br><br>- However after several flirtatious gestures Ellie begins to question if Dina really does loves Ellie, and Ellie ultimately begins to fall for her.<br><br>- Act 1 concludes with Diana and Ellie sharing an important intimate moment solidifying the relationship played through act 1.<br><br>- That is until they are interrupted and attacked by a religious sect called the Seraphites (one of 2 groups we encounter, the other being the WLF).<br><br>- Jackson is also attacked.<br><br>- Dina is killed in this attack.<br><br>- The Seraphites believe they are angels cleansing the wasteland. The old &quot;the end of the world is cause of the sinners&quot; trope.<br><br>- Anyone that is not a Seraphite is considered a &quot;wolf&quot; or &quot;enemy to the flock (the Seraphites)&quot;. They also refer to themselves as &quot;lambs&quot;<br><br>- In the vein of SJW baddies, the Seraphites dont like gays because its a sin.<br><br>- This is why all their members are *usually* white males with shaven heads or white women. And the few apostates (traitors) that leave the group tend to be minorities.<br><br>- Ellie vows to get revenge on the group.",http://i.4cdn.org/v/1586156129947.jpg

Subsequent Sonic games threw out this sort of intentional ambiguity and LORE since Heros wanted to go in a simpler direction and Shadow was never intended to come back, but the idea of Shadow not really being Shadow was re-used in Heros and Shadow the Hedgehog&#039;s plot, and Gerald researching ANcient Echidna stuff was confirmed in Sonic Battle.<br><br>3/3",

It easily has the best combat out of any FPS game and that isn&#039;t even debatable. Quake might let you do some more interesting movement tech, but the enemies don&#039;t push back nearly as hard as DE&#039;s. DE on nightmare plays unlike any other FPS made. Every enemy type is relevant, from start to finish. Not a lot of FPS, hell not even a lot of action games in general can claim that. DE also has an INSANE amount of enemy variety compared to most other games, which makes it even more impressive. You can like Duke, the og Doom games and/or Blood more for their non-linear level design, their &quot;soul&quot; or whatever, but DE&#039;s moment-to-moment combat is far, far superior to any of them. If you&#039;re like me and love FPS games specifically for their combat, DE is pretty much the perfect game. Its honestly like a dream come true. The only other classic FPS that comes close to pushing you as much as DE is Blood, but Blood literally only has one enemy type that matters, the cultists. Everything else might as well not even be there because they can&#039;t do anything to you. Blood also goes to shit halfway through, but that&#039;s a different discussion.",

If they play their cards right, this will probably be the biggest game trilogy (assuming it&#039;s a trilogy) to follow and get invested in, probably since Mass Effect.<br><br>As pissed as some fans will be, and some will probably remain so, you can bet your bottom dollar everyone is going to be speculating and waiting to see where the story goes next. For better or for worse, it&#039;s a bit of a genius move by Square.<br> <br><br>Bravo Nomura.",http://i.4cdn.org/v/1586158494175.jpg

Most of your time is going to be spent looking for a target but there&#039;s a time compression feature that lets you speed up the boring parts. Besides experimental late war prototypes there are no homing torpodes; there&#039;s a setting that aims them automatically for you but 90% of the game&#039;s fun comes from obtaining a correct manual solution and getting direct hits.<br><br>What game you want depends on your interest, if you&#039;re intrigued by the Pacific theater and sinking Jap boats then go with SH4 plus the U-boat missions add on. If you want Das Boot - The Video Game then both SH3 and SH5 are good contenders, the latter obviously looks better and has some very in depth mods but you can only play the VII type U-boat and crew management is more limited. And speaking of mods, they&#039;re pretty much essential for all of these games. You can find all the biggest ones on subsim.com which is pretty much the only place where SH is discussed these days.",

First, we need to investigate if there are any anomalies in Chargoff’s rules that state the count of %A’s ≈ the count of %T’s, and the count of the %G’s ≈ the count of %C’s. Refer to Fig. 1 for a table of some genomic properties. Therefore, first compute the nucleic acid (i.e. A’s, G’s, T’s, C’s) as a percent of the total sequence length (e.g. A/sequence length, etc.). To complete the characterization of each virus, we need to compute the AT GC ratio (A + T = G + C), gcContent ((G + C)/sequence length)), AT %, GC%, and the A/T and the G/C ratios to use in our virus similarity analysis. Refer to the provided example Python code and the print virus characteristics( seq ) function for a description of how to compute all the metrics.",http://i.4cdn.org/g/1586152194345.jpg

Despite warnings from the US to the British Government over National Security Risks for potential Chinese Espionage! .. it has been revealed that Boris Johnson gave China the green-light to begin the infrastructure of the 5G Network in our Country! Also this 5G network is to be installed in all our British Nuclear Power Plants around the country!! Which will give them full control. Beijing could use Huawei’s involvement as a back-door method of spying on British communications, and warned that it may scale down intelligence cooperation! There is already a Chinese owned power plant already being constructed in this Country! Also this will mean that our country could be held to ransom for a fall out if the network infrastructure is hacked! Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, faces charges that include alleged violation of sanctions against Iran. A Canadian court will decide if she’s extradited to the US, which has raised concerns about Chinese intelligence services using Huawei’s 5G technology as a so-called ‘back door’ to conduct operations in cyberspace.",http://i.4cdn.org/g/1586134089795.jpg

There&#039;s no unified grand vision from start to finish, up until Sekiro, where he states in the interviews that the game actually ended up mostly complete to specs without trashing too much shit. It&#039;s also the same reason why he had to ask George R. R.

The stories main driving point is the romance that briefly kindled between Dina and Ellie.<br><br>- Ellie and Joel are distant because of Joel being controlling stemming from the decision in TLoU but are starting to try and mend their relationship.<br><br>- There is a love triangle of sorts, not exactly a triangle as its just two people who love Dina, being Jesse and Ellie.<br><br>- Jesse (asian guy from the trailers) and Dina were a couple. Dina is bisexual.<br><br>- When Jesse and Dina are on the outs of their relationship Dina starts to make advances on Ellie.<br><br>- Due to Dina being the girl every guy wants and having a history dating men (men being a central driving force in this story) Ellie is cautious and is unsure of how serious Dina is.<br><br>- However after several flirtatious gestures Ellie begins to question if Dina really does loves Ellie, and Ellie ultimately begins to fall for her.<br><br>- Act 1 concludes with Diana and Ellie sharing an important intimate moment solidifying the relationship played through act 1.<br><br>- That is until they are interrupted and attacked by a religious sect called the Seraphites (one of 2 groups we encounter, the other being the WLF).<br><br>- Jackson is also attacked.<br><br>- Dina is killed in this attack.<br><br>- The Seraphites believe they are angels cleansing the wasteland. The old &quot;the end of the world is cause of the sinners&quot; trope.<br><br>- Anyone that is not a Seraphite is considered a &quot;wolf&quot; or &quot;enemy to the flock (the Seraphites)&quot;. They also refer to themselves as &quot;lambs&quot;<br><br>- In the vein of SJW baddies, the Seraphites dont like gays because its a sin.<br><br>- This is why all their members are *usually* white males with shaven heads or white women. And the few apostates (traitors) that leave the group tend to be minorities.<br><br>- Ellie vows to get revenge on the group.",http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1586155519644.jpg
513,/vg/,286694057,,"- Jesse joins her (That is Jesse in the trailer grabbing Ellies mouth, not Joel) as he also loved Dina. He is later killed as Ellie watches.<br><br>- Ellie goes to her old house.<br><br>- Then Joel joins her. Until he dies too.<br><br>- In the trailer you can see the Seraphites hanging people. This is because they use the old medieval method called &quot;hanging and quartering&quot;<br><br>- They only hang and disembowel former Seraphites. The disembowelment is for traitors or &quot;Apostates&quot;.<br><br>- On the way to avenge Dina they have to cross through WLF territory.<br><br>- The leader of the WLF is Marlenes brother.<br><br>- Joel Dies and Ellie questions if her quest for revenge was worth losing Joel who she only recently mended her strained relationship with.<br><br>- The Seraphites are all immune<br><br>- The cut on the cheek is a test for immunity. An infected knife.<br><br>- Flashback happens<br><br>- The Mystery woman in the trailer is Ellies mom.<br><br>- Ellies mom was looking for a cure<br><br>- She has a baby with a man that is immune<br><br>- the man is killed for sleeping with a &quot;wolf&quot; or outsider<br><br>- Marlene and Anna (Mystery Woman) were friends.<br><br>- Anna gives birth to Ellie then had Ellie taken away after being born to get her away from Marlene and the Seraphites.<br><br>- Marlene (who is WLF) is then sent to retrieve<br>Ellie and eventually finds her, using her friendship with Anna to win Ellies trust<br><br>- Ellie ends up with Seraphite girlfriend who wont turn when they exchange fluids",

0,/r9k/,23675577,Welcome to /r9k/,"/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts.<br><br>

1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>
2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>
3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, 
your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>
4. Backlinks, eg <span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the 
eyes of the robot.<br>
5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>
6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>
7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>
8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>
9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>
10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>
11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>
12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD:<br>

With Corona I predict a lot of young people will fail the class or be fucked. If you fail, just know most people don&#039;t even finish college. But you still can with a little work. Can you change majors? Industrial design may pay less, but there are many things you can do to increase your income well in the field. Many people can use a designer. Many people lack creativity and the skill to draw. With youtube and maybe a website? You could reach your own clients. Many people in any country lack a good looking house and go day to day without even the thought of redesigning their space. The engineering job I expect will make you more money and is a safer bet, but don&#039;t force yourself. If you would like to stop college have plan. Don&#039;t drop out or just fail your classes. Don&#039;t overthink recession or how much a job pays. The reason people in creative fields make no money is because they lack the ability to market themselves and treat the art as a skill, not as a money maker. Think of how you can make money with designing. Make a chart showing advantages and disadvantages of both fields.",

330,/r9k/,57518171,I&#039;m a cold person,"I identify a lot with you r9k people, so I assume you and I are very similar in terms of general personality traits. I am a very cold person on the exterior, but on the inside I am constantly either mildly unhappy to deeply hateful and scared of myself. I am 20 years old and I am terrified I will never make any new meaningful connections with anyone. My dad sometimes says he never knows how to approach me because I am always stone faced, and he never knows how I&#039;m feeling. Back in middle school I would be teased for sounding high, because my voice was always flat and monotone. I am not scared (I think) of approaching women, yet I never have gone for it. On 3 separate occasions I consciously knew 3 different girls were obviously flirting with me, yet I shot them all down with signs of disinterest, even though I was interested. I have only 2 male friends at the moment, and I only hang out with one of them like once a month. My mom dug up some home videos on VHS from 2004 of me fishing and playing and stuff. She was so happy to see it for the first time in 15 years, and I put on a happy face for her. On the inside, it was hard watching a small version of myself without all the emotionally cold built up dread I have felt for the better part of a decade. I hate to blame other people for my shortcomings, but I&#039;m pretty sure this started after my dad started being really mean to me and my brothers when I was 11. They are mostly nice now, but it is hard being forced to live at home instead of the college dorms.

This desire is so all consuming it has to be mentioned in every one of their posts. These creatures that are incels and LGBTQ posters spawn more cancers. Incels invite femanons, femanons invite tranny LARPers who want to be like them and etc. because of their shallow nature and ever growing population when failed normies come, posting quality drops dramatically<br><br>You must remember the biggest trick failed normies have ever pulled is convincing you that they are the same as you. THEY ARE NOT LIKE YOU. They are the pinnacle of human degeneracy and sin. Nothing matters to them but sensory pleasures. So all their posts are whining about having none and LARPing to emulate the experiance of being normie. Normies come to visit. Failed normies come to BE normies.<br>They are very numerous.
